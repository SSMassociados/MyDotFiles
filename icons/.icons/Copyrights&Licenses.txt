:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Vibrancy Colors Icon Theme :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This icon theme is a fusion of many great open source icon themes by many open source artists.
It was merged together, tweaked, fixed up and compiled by the RAVEfinity Project, You can visit us At: http://www.ravefinity.com/

It's really hard for us (RAVEfinity) to take alot of credit for Vibrancy Colors. It is such a diverse melting pot of amazing open source artwork by lots of amazing people (More amazing then us). We want to give the other desingners proper credit. We sort of take on a "Creative Director" like role in our own theme (We don't tell anyone else what to do, We just direct our vison into our work since all the work is Open Source and we can modify and redistribute it). We change things as needed to achive a certin look and overall design vison/goal.

That being said it is a unique theme. It's not just things thrown together. We work really hard to make it seemless and we make touches of our own.

This Icon Theme is very much what it is thanks to Sam Hewitt, The Designer and creator of Moka and Faba Icons. He spent mouths (Im Guessing) drawing all thease beautiful app icons. Consider Buying Sam a Coffe here: http://mokaproject.com/about/
