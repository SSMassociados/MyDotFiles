Vibrancy Colors should work on any GTK Desktop On Any distro. but it has not been tested on ones released before then 2014. We did some complex linking and inheriting to make the theme slim and as few files as possible (We got it down from 121,000 files to about 43,000) this may cause issues on some older desktops but most likely not.

We have gone through alot of things and made them even better including dozens of little "paper cut" issues reported by users and found by us. Added New GTK3 Monotone Symbolic Icons, Makes GnomeShell , Cinnamon look nicer and Makes the GTK3 browse dialog look slick.

Update 1.1: Fixes DOCX Mimetype Icons, Adds Apple(TM) DMG Disk Image Icon, RedShift Mono Icon for dark theme. 

We ARE NOT trying to take much credit for this icon theme as we feel it would be disrespectful to the authors whos work it uses. However please note we did spend alot of time putting it together (Think of us like a linux distro, compiling lots of things and making sure it works and looks good) We did some design, testing, tweaking and fixing issues. Engineering a icon theme like this is not simple as it would seem. It's very complex with all the colors and versions. But the authors of the other icon themes used in this most likely did way more work as they created things from scratch. 

PLEASE SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS:
THIS THEME IS MADE UP OF OTHERS AMAZING OPEN SOURCE HARD WORK:

Do Not credit us for everything, This theme is made up of others beautiful hard work, please support the authors. 
We do not want to hurt anyones endeavors or the community. This is NOT a FORK of anything whatsoever. 
It's just a fusion of some really awesome themes into another awesome theme (We Hope).
